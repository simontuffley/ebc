      <strong>HOW TO USE THIS TOOL</strong>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This is an open access online knowledge management tool designed to help users explore the existing evidence on linkages between nature and people. The evidence collated in this tool is designed to help conservation and development policymakers, practitioners, and researchers identify relevant information for decision-making. To date, there are ~1,000 peer-reviewed articles, unpublished reports, and theses in the evidence base that were identified and included using a systematic mapping method. You can read more about the motivation behind this project, the data and methodology, and this group in the 
      <span style="color:#006666">

        <strong>FAQs</strong>
      </div>
    </h4>
    
    <h5>
      <div>
        <strong>I am looking for a specific action or outcome, how do I find out what category that falls into?</strong>
      </div>
    </h5>
    <p>The glossary is the best place to figure out what types of actions or outcomes fall into which categories. Since we used either standardized typologies or synthesized frameworks, the definitions stem from those references. Below the definition, you find examples of what types of actions are included. The glossary can be found at the bottom of every page. Click the 'Show/Hide glossary' button to display the panel. You can also find the glossary in the ABOUT section, and then navigating to GLOSSARY.</p>
    
    <h5>
      <div>
        <strong>Where do I filter data and explore it? Why are there so many different options?</strong>
      </div>
    </h5>
    <p>This site is constantly in development and we are refining it to make searching for and exploring data as functional and intuitive as possible.  We encourage you to watch the how-to video on how to explore, filter, and download data.</p>
    <p>
      In general, options for exploration are located in the 
      <span style="color:#006666">
        <strong>EXPLORE</strong>
      </span>
        section. In the 
      <span style="color:#006666">
        <strong>EVIDENCE MAP</strong>
      </span>
        tab, you will find an interactive evidence map that highlights the number of articles that document a specific linkage between a type of intervention and a type of outcome. You can filter this map by region, major habitat type, and study type. You can also view the data table behind this map by clicking on the 
      <span style="color:#006666">
        <strong>DATA TABLE</strong>
      </span>
        tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 
      <span style="color:#006666">
        <strong>LINKAGE EXPLORER</strong>
      </span>
        affords a different interaction with the map, allowing you dive into a specific linkage and view a bibliography of included articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 
      <span style="color:#006666">
        <strong>DASHBOARD</strong>
      </span>
        tab allows for filtering by geographic region, habitat/ecoregion type, intervention type, and outcome type. Here you can view summaries of different variables, explore the full data, and visualize spatially on both choropleth and interactive maps.

    <h5>
      <div>
        <strong>Are there other efforts to expand from this evidence map or on other topics?</strong>
      </div>
    </h5>

      You can read more about ongoing work to build this evidence base and conduct in-depth syntheses on some of these linkages in the

      The concept for the Evidence for Nature and People Data Portal was conceived by the Evidence-Based Conservation Working Group. This portal is supported by the 
      <a href="http://snappartnership.net">Science for Nature and People Partnership</a>
        consisting of , 
      <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)</a>
      , 
      <a href="http://www.nature.org">The Nature Conservancy</a>
      , and the 
      <a href="http://www.wcs.org">Wildlife Conservation Society</a>
      . Without the technical expertise and computing support from the 
      <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/ecoinfo#team">scientific computing team at NCEAS</a>
        (Julien Brun, Nick Outin, Ian McCullough, Sarah McCutcheon, Justin Kroes, Mark Schildhauer, &amp; Lauren Walker) this tool would not have been possible. This tool was developed and piloted with a number of potential end-users including scientists, researchers, and practitioners from multiple academic, conservation, and development institutions and agencies.
