      <strong>HOW THE DATA WAS COMPILED</strong>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The data in this portal was generated using a peer-reviewed systematic map protocol (
      <a href="http://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-3-16">Bottrill et al. 2014</a>
      ) and documented in 
      <a href="https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0058-7">McKinnon et al. 2016</a>
      . This systematic map consists of articles that measure some impact of a nature-based conservation intervention (as defined by the IUCN-Conservation Measures Partnership (IUCN-CMP) Unified Classification of Conservation Actions) on aspects of human well-being. This map is limited to studies that examined these impacts in non-OECD countries.
