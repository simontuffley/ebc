        <h3>About Evidence Synthesis Methodologies</h3>
  
        <p>Systematic maps and reviews are transparent, robust, and repeatable methods used to identify and synthesize relevant evidence within a policy-relevant framework. These maps and reviews (SMs and SRs) aim to synthesize large bodies of evidence while minimizing bias in order to provide reliable and comprehensive information for examining impacts and informing decision making. SMs and SRs are widely conducted and used within the medical and public health sector, providing critical syntheses informing best practices and treatment efficacy (Cochrane Collaboration). Systematic maps are particularly useful for assessing the current state of the evidence base, characterizing the research that has been conducted and where key knowledge gaps exist. Both SMs and SRs are increasingly being applied to conservation, environmental management, and development fields (Pullin &amp; Stewart 2006).</p>
  
        <p>In systematic mapping, the searching and inclusion processes are conducted with the same comprehensive method as for a full review, but the process does not extend to critical appraisal or data synthesis. Data are however extracted from included studies in order to describe important aspects of the studies using a standard template and defined keywords and coding. This approach is designed to capture information on generic variables, such as the country in which a study took place, the population focus, study design and the intervention being assessed. This standard and well-defined set of keywords and codes is essential whenever classifying and characterising studies in order for reviewers to pull out key aspects of each study in a systematic way. Once the research has been mapped in this way it is then possible to identify pools of research which may be used to identify more narrowly defined review questions.</p>
