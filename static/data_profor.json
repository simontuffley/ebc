In essence, the programs are intended to achieve these twin goals by incentivizing local communities to manage state forests. However, there are pervasive imperfections in forest products markets that constrain the needed incentives; these imperfections arise mainly from limited infrastructure, high transport costs, few buyers, exploitive marketing chains and imperfect price information. One innovative approach to overcome these problems, which has been adopted by the Ethiopian government, is to organize JFM into community forest enterprises (CFE) in the form of forest usersâ€™ cooperatives (FUC) for forest products marketing.4 This provides the community with avenues for greater participation in value chains of forest products markets through vertical integration (VI) (Antinori, 2005; Gelo and Koch, 2014; Vega and Keenan, 2014). Vertical integration is expected to raise NTFP prices and hence spurs the required incentives by shortening the marketing chain and increasing bargaining power of farmers along NTFP market value chain.'","Int_dur":"2001-present","Int_geo":"local","Impl_type":"non_prof","Stated_outcomes":"Changes in household welfare","No_outcomes":"1","Portion_livelihood":"No","Portion_livelihood_amount":"","oid":"71.1","Study_goal":"It is aimed at evaluating the income and distributive effects of a JFM program augmented by market linkage interventions.'","Study_location":"Gimbo District","Forest_type":"Secondary or regenerating natural forest","Unit_analysis":"Household","Study_duration":"9-Oct","Design_control":"Yes","Design_comps":"Yes","Comps_notes":"","Disagg_gender":"No","Disagg_soc_eco":"Yes","Disagg_race":"No","Eval_affil_type":"acad","Expl_mechanism":"","Stated_mech":"","Stated_model":"","PRIME":"Rights","Model_use":"NA"},{"aid":72,"Authors":"Ghorbani A, Langenberger G, Liu JX, Wehner S, Sauerborn J","Pub_year":"2012","geo":[{"Study_country.x":"China","id":156,"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia"}],"outcome":[{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"Collection and income from bamboo shoot collection (as proxy for NTFP collection and income)","Outcome.data_type":"Quantitative","Out_subtype":"mon_dir","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"}],"intervention":[{"Int_type":"hab_mgmt"},{"Int_type":"eco_ser"}],"study":"non_exp","habitat":[{"Biome.":"T_TSTMBF"}],"comparator":[{"Comps_type":"other"}],"Assessor":"Sam","Pub_type":"Peer-reviewed published journal article","Title":"Diversity of Medicinal and Food Plants as Non-timber Forest Products in Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (China): Implications for Livelihood Improvement and Biodiversity Conservation","Journal":"Economic Botany","Vol":"66","Page_num":"178-191","Author_affil":"Institute of Plant Production and Agroecology in the Tropics and Subtropics, University of Hohenheim, GarbenstraÃŸe 13, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany","Funding":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (FN.: 0330797A) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)","Linked_refs":"","Affil_type":"academic","Stated_int":"NTFP management around Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve","Desired_out":"the nature reserve administration office set regulations on access to the resources based on village boundaries and proposed a biannual collection scheme'","Int_dur":"2004?","Int_geo":"local","Impl_type":"pub_sect","Stated_outcomes":"Contribution of sale of bamboo shoots to income","No_outcomes":"1","Portion_livelihood":"Yes","Portion_livelihood_amount":"0.16-3.8% of per capita income","oid":"72.1","Study_goal":"this work aims to introduce NTFPs harvested in NRWNNR, with a focus on medicinal and food plants, and highlights their role in the livelihood of local people.'","Study_location":"Villages (Na Ban, Pan Bing, Da Nuo You, Xiao Nuo You Shang Zhai, Ben Gan Hani, Mang Xin Long La) around Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve is located in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southernmost part of Yunnan province","Forest_type":"Old-growth natural forest","Unit_analysis":"Community","Study_duration":"2 years","Design_control":"No","Design_comps":"Yes","Comps_notes":"Villages","Disagg_gender":"No","Disagg_soc_eco":"No","Disagg_race":"No","Eval_affil_type":"acad","Expl_mechanism":"No","Stated_mech":"","Stated_model":"","PRIME":"Markets","Model_use":"NA"},{"aid":73,"Authors":"GOBEZE T, BEKELE M, LEMENIH M, and KASSA H","Pub_year":"2009","geo":[{"Study_country.x":"Ethiopia","id":231,"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa"}],"outcome":[{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"Average income from various sources before and after PFM","Outcome.data_type":"Quantitative","Out_subtype":"mon_dir","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"}],"intervention":[{"Int_type":"gov"},{"Int_type":"emp"}],"study":"non_exp","habitat":[{"Biome.":"NA"}],"comparator":[{"Comps_type":"ba"},{"Comps_type":"between"}],"Assessor":"Kavita Macleod","Pub_type":"Peer-reviewed published journal article","Title":"Participatory forest management and its impacts on\nlivelihoods and forest status: the case of Bonga forest in\nEthiopia","Journal":"International Forestry Review","Vol":"11 (3)","Page_num":"346","Author_affil":"Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources, Shashamane, 128, Ethiopia","Funding":"We acknowledge the financial support of Wondo Genet\nCollege of Forestry and Natural Resources of Hawassa\nUniversity from its Sida funded development oriented action\nresearch programme","Linked_refs":"","Affil_type":"academic","Stated_int":"Participatory Forest Management in Ethiopia","Desired_out":"Sustainable forest management;

Section 6 highlights the need for a more comprehensive SCBA that would take into account the value of local ecological services from JFM forests.'","Study_location":"Sarsa, Kelende, Bisa, Sadma, Banadag, Saheda, Tengariya, Bargainbanda villages - Ranchi District, Jharkhand State","Forest_type":"","Unit_analysis":"Household","Study_duration":"1 year (1996)","Design_control":"No","Design_comps":"Yes","Comps_notes":"","Disagg_gender":"No","Disagg_soc_eco":"Yes","Disagg_race":"No","Eval_affil_type":"acad","Expl_mechanism":"","Stated_mech":"","Stated_model":"","PRIME":"Rights","Model_use":"NA"},{"aid":104,"Authors":"Lambini CK, Nguyen TT","Pub_year":"2014","geo":[{"Study_country.x":"Viet Nam","id":704,"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"},{"Study_country.x":"Ghana","id":288,"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa"}],"outcome":[{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"Change in livelihoods","Outcome.data_type":"Both","Out_subtype":"mon_dir","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"},{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"Change in livelihoods","Outcome.data_type":"Both","Out_subtype":"mon_wage","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"},{"Out_type.inc_con":"0","Out_type.cap_asset":"1","Indicators":"Access, use or withdrawl, exclusion and alienation rights","Outcome.data_type":"Both","Out_subtype":"nat_for","Out_type_assigned":"cap_asset"}],"intervention":[{"Int_type":"for_mgmt"},{"Int_type":"gov"}],"study":"non_exp","habitat":[{"Biome.":"T_TSTMBF"}],"comparator":[{"Comps_type":"other"}],"Assessor":"Sam","Pub_type":"Peer-reviewed published journal article","Title":"A comparative analysis of the effects of institutional property rights on forest livelihoods and forest conditions: Evidence from Ghana and Vietnam","Journal":"Forest Policy and Economics","Vol":"38","Page_num":"178-190","Author_affil":"BayCEER, Bayreuth University, Universitaetstr. 30, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Funding":"  ","Linked_refs":"Nguyen et al. 2010, Nguyen 2012","Affil_type":"academic","Stated_int":"Forest institutional property rights","Desired_out":"Effective and robust forest institutional property rights are increasingly becoming an important part on the allocation of scarce forest resources and a solution to the â€œtragedy of the commonsâ€'","Int_dur":"Varies","Int_geo":"national","Impl_type":"pub_sect","Stated_outcomes":"Change in livelihoods, change in forest conditions, change in access","No_outcomes":"2","Portion_livelihood":"No","Portion_livelihood_amount":"","oid":"104.1","Study_goal":"The main motivation of this study is our need to understand the role of institutions, property rights on livelihoods in a forestry context and examine the connectivity of these three concepts.

As a result, since the mid-1990s, forest cover has been improved by the establishment of exclosures (e.g. Asefa et al. 2003) and woodlots (Jagger & Pender 2003), as well as agroforestry, land certification for use, and integrated soil and water management (Haile et al. 2006). In addition, some land rehabilitation activities have been undertaken via food-for-work schemes.' 'In 1991, the idea of dividing the degraded and unproductive communal hillsides into smaller plots and allocating them to individuals for tree planting was initiated by local communities. Community elders and priest farmers described their ideas through the use of chronological depictions of interventions intended to provide solutions to degraded hillsides, and showed a timeline for the pro- posed activities. In this way, members of the local communities were able to express their wishes for the hills to become productive once again and hence transform their livelihoods. The demand-driven initiative was sub- sequently put into practice by local administrators and influenced both the regional land policy and the national land policy.

Tumpang sari (TS), a\ntemporal type of agroforestry, is a conventional way to\nprovide such incentive.In TS, a parcel of state\nforestland is allocated to a farm household where\nmembers of that household plant teak trees and\nmaintain the young trees for 2 years. TS attracts small\nor landless farmers in need of cultivation land who are\ndependent on forest resources for their livelihoods. In\nexchange for labor contributed toward planting and\nmaintaining the trees, TS farmers receive a small cash\npayment and can keep all yields from intercropping of\nfood crops such as maize (Zea mays indentata), peanut\n(Arachis hypogaea L.), and cassava (Manihot esculenta).\nAfter 2 years, the farmers have to leave their TS\nparcel and can cultivate in a new parcel.
